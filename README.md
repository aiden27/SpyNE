# SpyNE
SpyNE is a minimalist deep learning famework written 
"purely" in python. 

It's simplicty makes it an excellent
learning and prototyping tool.

SpyNE features a dead-simple api, super readable code,
no dependencies (other than numpy), eager execution by 
default and an accesible but detailed explanation of the underlying 
mathematical framework.

#### Modules
SpyNE features custom implementations of the following:
- Automatic Differentiation (Reverse Mode)
- Optimization Engines
- An API to translate neural architectures into the AD 
  mini-language
  
Generally these are the fundamental components to all deep
learning frameworks.


#### Project Status
